# Solving Leetcode Practice Problem 312: Bursting Balloons - https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/
# Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.
# Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
# Note:
# You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.

0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100

            leftVal = 1 # needs to be 1 initially
            rightVal = 1 # needs to be 1 initially
            # However, if there is an element to the right or left of the current k, then its value will be found below
            if (i != 0):
                leftVal = nums[i-1] # getting value to the immediate left if the i value is not the first element of nums
            if (j != (size - 1)):
                rightVal = nums[j+1] # getting value to the immediate right if the j value is not the last element of nums

            leftarray_points = 0 # setting to zero at beginning
            rightarray_points = 0 # setting to zero at beginning
            # However, if there is a subarray to the left or right of the current array, its value needs to be defined based on previous iterations
            if (i != k): # if k is not the first element
                leftarray_points = Array_points[i][k-1]
            if (j != k): # if k is not the last element
                rightarray_points = Array_points[k+1][j]

            Array_points[i][j] = max(Array_points[i][j], (leftVal * nums[k] * rightVal) + leftarray_points + rightarray_points)

print(Array_points)
# print(Array_points[0][size - 1]) # entry corresponding to a subarray with index from 0 to size - 1, aka the full vector (recursively defined based on smaller subarrays)
